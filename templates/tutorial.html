<p><b>Chromosome</b>: chromosome in reference genome<br>
<b>Position</b>: coordinate on chromosome<br>
<b>Gene</b>: overlapping gene<br>
<b>Strand</b>: + for positive strand, - for negative strand (with respect to reference genome)<br>
<b>Annotation</b>: Genic location<br>
<b>Annotation2</b>: If edit is located with a coding sequence, the predicted amino acid variation. If edit is not within a coding sequence, the genic location.<br>
<b>Genomic Location</b>: Specifies whether the editing site is located in an Alu repeat, non-Alu repeat, or nonrepetitive region of the genome. Clicking on this field links to the editing site in the UCSC browser, showing the overlapping genes and genomic nucleotide conservation:</p>

<p><b>Conservation of Edit</b>: Species in which editing is known to be conserved. Clicking on this field links to the editing site in the UCSC browser for the selected species, showing the overlapping genes and genomic nucleotide conservation<br>
<b>Reference</b>: Study in which the editing site was identified. Clicking on this link redirects to the pubmed reference.<br>
